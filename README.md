## Requirements

- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) `(ver >= 1.1.8)`
- A folder(s) of local images and just image(s) located somewhere in your vault

## Installation

Obsidian Image Gallery can be installed from within Obsidian, as for [every other community plugin](https://help.obsidian.md/Advanced+topics/Community+plugins#Discover+and+install+community+plugins).

## Usage

To create a dynamic gallery, add one of the following code blocks to a note (make sure to customize the paths in `targets`!):

For a horizontal masonry:
````
```img-gallery
targets: Attachments/Folder
type: horizontal
```
````

For a vertical masonry:
````
```img-gallery
targets: Attachments/Folder
type: vertical
```
````

For a multiple files:
````
```img-gallery
targets:
- Attachments/Folder
- Attachments/Folder2/pony.png
type: horizontal
```
````

Take a look at [settings](#settings) to see how to tweak some properties of the gallery; the examples available above are the most minimal configuration possible.

In *[Live Preview](https://help.obsidian.md/Live+preview+update)* mode, the gallery will be generated after moving the cursor outside the code block. Using the regular *Source Mode*, press `cmd+e` (or `ctrl+e`) to trigger Obsidian's Note Preview.

`1.1.1` introduces a lightbox view accessible by clicking on any image part of the gallery. Then, if you need to, click the button on the top right to open the original image in a new tab.

## Settings

Settings can be customized in any order, in `yaml` syntax. Optional properties default to the values outlined in the tables below:

| Option    | Default      | Alternatives    | Required        | Description                                                |
| --------- | ------------ | --------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `targets` | -            | -               | Yes             | Paths to folders and images relative to root of the vaults |
| `path`    | -            | -               | No (deprecated) | Path relative to the root of the vault                     |
| `type`    | `horizontal` | `vertical`      | No              | Type of masonry                                            |
| `gutter`  | `8`          | (any number)    | No              | Spacing in px between the images                           |
| `radius`  | `0`          | (any number)    | No              | Border radius in px of the images                          |
| `sortby`  | `ctime`      | `mtime`, `name` | No              | Sort images by                                             |
| `sort`    | `desc`       | `asc`           | No              | Order of sorting                                           |

Options applicable only for `type=horizontal`:

| Option   | Default | Alternatives | Required | Description              |
| -------- | ------- | ------------ | -------- | ------------------------ |
| `height` | `260`   | (any number) | No       | Height in px of all rows |

Options applicable only for `type=vertical`:

| Option    | Default | Alternatives | Required | Description                   |
| --------- | ------- | ------------ | -------- | ----------------------------- |
| `columns` | `3`     | (any number) | No       | Number of columns for desktop |
| `mobile`  | `1`     | (any number) | No       | Number of columns for mobile  |


## Notes:
- For `targets` there is no need to specify the name of the vault.
- As mentioned in the [Requirements](#requirements) section, only local images are accepted. This plugin was designed with a specific use case in mind: create a gallery from a folder of images with as little setup as possible.
- Make sure the images to embed have a reasonable size: generating a masonry with 60 4k photos will most likely slow down the app to a crawl!

An additional note about the orientation of the masonry vs. the distribution of its images: [until a true masonry layout](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-grid-3/) is available for native `css` grids, the sorting of the vertical version is a hit or miss. This is because the flow of its elements goes from top to bottom (see [this article](https://css-tricks.com/piecing-together-approaches-for-a-css-masonry-layout) for more info about it.) If sorting is critical, please rely on the horizontal version; its images are sometimes cropped, but their ordering is way more intuitive.

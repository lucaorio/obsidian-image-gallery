Obsidian Image Gallery is currently [pending review](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases/pull/961).
Until then, feel free to install it manually by cloning/downloading this repository, moving its folder into your `MyVault/.obsidian/plugins` folder, and building it with `npm`.

If you're unsure how to build it, you can grab the `main.js` file [from here](https://github.com/lucaorio/obsidian-image-gallery/releases/tag/1.0.0) and copy/paste it inside the folder you previously moved into your plugin folder.

**Please, keep in mind that proceeding this way is not best practice, and I'm not sure the plugin will receive updates later on!**

# Obsidian Image Gallery
Obsidian Image Gallery is a zero setup masonry image gallery for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

## Requirements

- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) `(ver >= 0.14.6)`
- A folder(s) of local images located somewhere in your vault

## Installation

Obsidian Image Gallery can be installed from within Obsidian, as for [every other community plugin](https://help.obsidian.md/Advanced+topics/Community+plugins#Discover+and+install+community+plugins).

## Usage

To create a dynamic gallery, add one of the following code blocks to a note (make sure to customize the path!):

For a horizontal masonry:
````
```img-gallery
path: Attachments/Folder
type: horizontal
```
````

For a vertical masonry:
````
```img-gallery
path: Attachments/Folder
type: vertical
```
````

Take a look at [settings](#settings) to see how to tweak some properties of the gallery; the examples available above are the most minimal configuration possible.

In *[Live Preview](https://help.obsidian.md/Live+preview+update)* mode, the gallery will be generated after moving the cursor outside the code block. Using the regular *Source Mode*, press `cmd+e` (or `ctrl+e`) to trigger Obsidian's Note Preview.

## Settings

Settings can be customized in any order, in `yaml` syntax. Optional properties default to the values outlined in the list of bullet points below:

- `path: Attachments/Folder` (**required**, path relative to the root of your vault)
- `type: horizontal` (**optional**, type of masonry `horizontal` or `vertical`)
- `gutter: 8` (**optional**, spacing between the images)
- `radius: 0` (**optional**, border radius of the images)
- `sortby: ctime` (**optional**, sort by `ctime`, `mtime`, or `name`)
- `sort: desc` (**optional**, order of sorting: `desc` or `asc`)
- `preview: false` (**optional**, whether to display image previews on click)

Applicable to `type: horizontal` only:

- `height: 260` (**optional**, height in px of all rows)

Applicable to `type=vertical` only:

- `columns: 3` (**optional**, number of columns for desktop)
- `mobile: 1` (**optional**, number of columns for mobile)

## Notes:
- For `path` there is no need to specify the name of the vault
- As mentioned in the [Requirements](#requirements) section, only local images are accepted. This plugin was designed with a specific use case in mind: create a gallery from a folder of images with as little setup as possible.
- Make sure the images to embed have a reasonable size: generating a masonry with 60 4k photos will most likely slow down the app to a crawl!

An additional note about the orientation of the masonry vs. the distribution of its images: [until a true masonry layout](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-grid-3/) is available for native `css` grids, the sorting of the vertical version is a hit or miss. This is because the flow of its elements goes from top to bottom (see [this article](https://css-tricks.com/piecing-together-approaches-for-a-css-masonry-layout) for more info about it.) If sorting is critical, please rely on the horizontal version; its images are sometimes cropped, but their ordering is way more intuitive.
